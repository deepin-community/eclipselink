*** Removal of functionalities ***

EclipseLink Debian package doesn't contain some of the functionalities
of upstream binary releases.

Here is a list of excluded files regarding original content of EclipseLink
2.0.x:

* libeclipselink-java
  [non-free] Oracle RDBMS. Code depending on this software cannot be compiled
    and included because it is not available in Debian since it is non-free
    software.

    org/eclipse/persistence/platform/database/oracle/**
    org/eclipse/persistence/platform/xml/xdk/**

    code in the tarball.
