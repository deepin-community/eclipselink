 Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
 .
     THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
     PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
     OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
   a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
      Distributed under this Agreement, and
 .
   b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      i) changes to the Program, and
      ii) additions to the Program;
   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
   and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
   "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
   such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
   Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
   are not Modified Works.
 .
 "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
 are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
 or when combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
 Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
 or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
 .
 "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
 .
 "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
 results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
 contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
 in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
 Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
 interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
 in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
 or Modified Works thereof.
 .
 "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
 in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
 .
 "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
 modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
 documentation source, and configuration files.
 .
 "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
 Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
 exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
 Contributor.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
   a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
   Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
 .
   b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
   if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
   apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
   the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
   of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
   combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
   licensed hereunder.
 .
   c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
   patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
   Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
   brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
   property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
   rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
   patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
   Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
   before distributing the Program.
 .
   d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 .
   e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
   Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
   those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
   receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
   (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
 .
   a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
   accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
   the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
   is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
   obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
   used for software exchange; and
 .
   b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
   different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
      warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
      implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
      for a particular purpose;
 .
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
      liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
      incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 .
      iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
 .
      iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
      party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
      of this section 3.
 .
 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
 .
   a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
   Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
   files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
   Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
   Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
   under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
 .
   b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
   the Program.
 .
 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
 trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
 of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
 the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
 their own appropriate notices.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
 with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
 license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
 the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
 offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
 liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
 the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
 ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
 other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
 and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
 Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
 in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
 intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
 Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
 writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
 and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
 related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
 participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
 alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
 defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
 claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
 pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
 those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
 BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
 TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
 risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
 including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
 compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
 or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
 SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
 EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
 PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
 Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
 or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
 rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
 rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
 However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
 granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
 but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
 may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
 reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
 this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
 Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
 is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
 responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
 entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
 version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
 received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
 Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
 Contributions) under the new version.
 .
 Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
 receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
 Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
 estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
 under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
 to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
 No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
